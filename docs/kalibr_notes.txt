Kalibr AprilGrid front-end
--------------------------

- AprilTags by Michael Kaess
- Remove tag if distance to image border is less than 4px
- Remove tag if tag is not 'good' (calculated by AprilTags)!
- Perform corner subpixel refinement
- Remove corner if refined corner is ~1.2pixels away from prev
- Mark Grid detection failed if less than 4 tags detected


Kalibr Camera Calibration
-------------------------

Optimizes for:
- Camera intrinsics
- Camera-camera extrinsics
- Relative camera-target pose
- Target pose

Optimization settings:
- Sigma reprojectio: 1.0
- No losses

Calibration process:
- Initializes the camera intrinsics for each camera
  - By solving BA
- Initializes the camera to camera transforms
  - By solving BA
- Solves the optimization problem in an incremental manner
- Removes outliers from current views
- Removes view if information gain isn't high enough
  - svLog2Sum = S.head(rank).array().log().sum() / log(2)
  - 0.5 - (svLog2Sum_now - svLog2Sum_prev)


Kalibr IMU-Camera Calibration
-------------------------

Optimizes for:
- imu-cam0, imu-cam1, ... extrinsics
- imu sensor poses
- Target orientation

Optimization settings:
- Sigma reprojectio: 1.0
- No losses
- Max iter: 30
